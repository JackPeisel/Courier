If this directory is directly copied and used then .cr files can be written and ran using
the command /.cr [FILENAME].

If make clean is ran, there are only the .ml, parser.mly, and lexer.mll files, or someeone wishes to manually build to the state provided here then you
can perform the following steps:

Run these commands in the command line:

ocamlbuild -use-menhir -no-hygiene parser.ml
ocamlbuild -no-hygiene lexer.ml

Then move parser.ml, parser.mli, and lexer.ml out of _build and into the main 
directory where the other .ml files are (eval, ast, etc).

Now run make.

This should get the system to the state it is when downloaded as a zip on cms.
